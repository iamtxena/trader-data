# Platform API Entrypoint Contract

Gate0 rule for `trader-data`:

1. No public endpoint is defined in this repository during Gate0.
2. All external client traffic must enter through Platform API in `trade-nexus`.
3. Provider API interactions remain internal to adapter implementations.

Canonical public API source:

- `/Users/txena/sandbox/16.enjoy/trading/trade-nexus/docs/architecture/specs/platform-api.openapi.yaml`
